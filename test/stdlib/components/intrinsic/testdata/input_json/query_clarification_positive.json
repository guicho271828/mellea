      "content": "MOXIE has successfully produced oxygen from the Martian atmosphere, which could reduce the need to transport oxygen from Earth. However, the current version produces only a small fraction of what future missions would need. Whether NASA should prioritize this technology over other resources depends on various factors including mission objectives, available resources, and technological feasibility."

Jane is one of the many wizards at NASA who work every day to make the impossible, possible. The James Webb Space Telescope represents the very best of scientific discovery that will continue to unfold the secrets of our universe. We appreciate Ellen and Jane for their service to NASA, and our country.\"\nDr. Ellen Ochoa\n\nCredit: The White House\n\nOchoa retired from NASA in 2018 after more than 30 years with the agency. In addition to being an astronaut, she served a variety of positions over the years, including the 11th director of NASA Johnson, Johnson deputy center director, and director of Flight Crew Operations.\nShe joined the agency in 1988 as a research engineer at NASA's Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley, California, and moved to NASA Johnson in 1990 when she was selected as an astronaut. Ochoa became the first Hispanic woman to go to space when she served on the nine-day STS-56 mission aboard the space shuttle Discovery in 1993. She flew in space four times, including STS-66, STS-96 and STS-110.\nBorn in California, Ochoa earned a bachelor's degree in Physics from San Diego State University and a master's degree and doctorate in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University. As a research engineer at Sandia National Laboratories and NASA Ames Research Center, Ochoa investigated optical systems for performing information processing. She is a co-inventor on three patents and author of several technical papers.\n\"Wow, what an unexpected and amazing honor! I'm so grateful for all my amazing NASA colleagues who shared my career journey with me,\" said Ochoa upon hearing the news of her Presidential Medal of Freedom award.\nDuring her career, Ochoa also received NASA's highest award, the Distinguished Service Medal, and the Presidential Distinguished Rank Award for senior executives in the federal government. She has received many other awards and is especially honored to have seven schools named for her.\nOchoa also is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, and formerly chaired both the National Science Board and the Nomination Evaluation Committee for the National Medal of Technology and Innovation."
