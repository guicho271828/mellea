I need help planning a complete birthday party for my 8-year-old daughter who loves unicorns and
wants to invite 15 kids from her class, and I need you to create a detailed shopping list with
estimated costs for decorations, food, drinks, party favors, and a cake that serves at least 20 people,
then suggest 5-7 age-appropriate party games or activities that fit the unicorn theme and can keep the
kids entertained for about 3 hours, also write out a timeline for the party day starting from 2 hours
before guests arrive until cleanup is done showing exactly when to do food prep, decoration setup,
when each activity should happen, and when to serve food and cake, plus I need you to draft a cute
invitation text that I can send to parents that includes all the important details like date, time,
location, RSVP information, and any special instructions about allergies or what kids should bring or
wear, and finally create a backup plan in case it rains since I was planning to have some activities
outside in the backyard, and make sure everything stays within a total budget of about ~$400 and follows basic
food safety guidelines especially for kids with common allergies like nuts and dairy, and the party theme
colors should be pink, purple, and gold to match the unicorn decorations.
